## Untested AI models

### hf.co/second-state/Yi-1.5-9B-Chat-GGUF:Q2_K
TBD

### Claude
TODO test it

## AI models that refuse to generate payloads

### llama3.2:1b

Can be jailbroken but is non-deterministic. Don't use.

## AI models that sort of work

### deepseek-r1:1.5b

Includes a really long chain of thought in the output no matter what. I'm going to have to parse the response in a special way.

Also, it makes really, really strange payloads that don't make sense.

## AI models that work great
